/*
 * A nice combo pack of apollo libraries, like in memory cache, local state 
 * management, and error handling. Itâ€™s also flexible enough to handle 
 * features like authentication.
 * 
 * ApolloClient is the interface to the DB API within the client,
 * and it is exposed to the React application using a prop. Note
 * that because we are using next.js here, and server side 
 * rendering, that means we'll need to do a bit of extra work
 * using getInitialProps (see pages/_app.js) and the usage of
 * next-with-apollo as imported here (again, due to server side
 * rendering).
